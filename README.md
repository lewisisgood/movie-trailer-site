# My Favorite Movies Website
Source code for a Movie Trailer website.

This project is used to create a website that list my favorite movies along with their posters. When a user clicks on one of the posters, a trailer of the movie from Youtube plays in the same window.

This project is forked from Udacity's ud036_StarterCode. I implemented functionality in Python that generates a series of "Movie" classes, which are then used in launching a browser window with the newly created HTML website.


### Prerequesites
Ensure that Python 2.7+ and git are installed:
```
python --version
git --version
```


### Installing

From the Terminal, clone this repo onto your computer with:

```
git clone https://github.com/lewisisgood/movie-trailer-site
```

Move into the new directory:

```
cd movie-trailer-site/
```

Run the entertainment_center.py to generate the movie trailer website:

```
python entertainment_center.py
```

This will create an HMTL file called "fresh_tomatoes.html" and launch a browser displaying this new website.
